## What is a User?

A **User** is a professional (CA, lawyer, consultant) who uses SnapDocs.

Users:
- Own all data
- Create clients
- Create requests
- Track document progress

## Why Users Exist

- Clear data ownership
- Enables multi-user orgs later
- Prevents data leakage

---

## Key Design Decisions

- Users are internal (they log in)
- Clients are external (they usually don’t)
- Users never upload client documents directly

---

## Future Scope (Not Now)

- Organizations
- Roles (admin/member)
- Team collaboration
