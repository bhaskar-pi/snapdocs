# SnapDocs – Documentation

This folder contains all product and data-model documentation for SnapDocs.

SnapDocs is a **document collection workflow system**, not just a file storage app.

Core idea:

> Track what is required → track what is missing → track what is received.

## Core Concepts (Quick)

- **User** → Professional using SnapDocs
- **Client** → Person/company sending documents
- **Request** → A document collection task
- **Checklist Item** → One expected document
- **Document** → Actual uploaded file
- **Template** → Reusable checklist

---

## Reading Order (Recommended)

1. `data-model.md` (core design)
2. `users.md`
3. `clients.md`
4. `requests.md`
5. `checklist-items.md`
6. `documents.md`
7. `templates.md`

## Design Principles

- Model **intent before files**
- Preserve history
- Avoid premature complexity
- Optimize for developer maintainability
