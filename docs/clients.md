# Clients

## What is a Client?

A **Client** is a real-world person or business from whom documents are collected.

Examples:
- Individual taxpayer
- Company
- Legal client

---

## Why Clients Are Separate from Users

- Clients are external
- One user manages many clients
- Clients do not own data

---

## Client Capabilities

- Can have multiple requests over time
- Has contact info for reminders
- Has historical record

---

## UI Mapping

### Clients Page
- List of all clients

### Client Details Page
- Client info
- All requests created for this client

---

## What Clients Do NOT Contain

- Documents
- Checklist items
- Status logic

All workflow lives in **requests**.
